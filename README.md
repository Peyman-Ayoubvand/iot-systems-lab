# IoT Systems Lab

Arduino and ESP32 projects are organized as a structured learning and development portfolio for embedded systems and IoT engineering.

---

## Purpose

This repository documents my hands-on journey in:
- Embedded programming
- Electronics and sensors
- Device communication
- IoT systems development

The goal is to build practical, real-world projects rather than only theoretical exercises.

## Workflow

Each topic contains:
- README → explanation of the concept/project
- src → code implementations
- images → circuit photos or schematics
- notes → debugging notes and lessons learned
