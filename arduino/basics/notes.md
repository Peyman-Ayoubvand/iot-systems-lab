## Introduction to Arduino

- Arduino is both hardware (a microcontroller board) and software (Arduino IDE).
- It is an open-source ecosystem.
- Open-source means anyone can modify the hardware design or the software.
- The main purpose of Arduino is rapid prototyping.
- Rapid prototyping allows quick testing:
  Write code → Upload to board → Test → Modify quickly.
- It is mainly used for robotics and electronics projects.
