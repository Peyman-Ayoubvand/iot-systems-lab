## Introduction to Arduino

- Arduino is both hardware (a microcontroller board) and software (Arduino IDE).
- It is an open-source ecosystem.
- Open-source means the hardware designs and software code are publicly available and can be modified by anyone.
- The main purpose of Arduino is rapid prototyping.
- Rapid prototyping allows quick testing:
  Write code → Upload to board → Test → Modify quickly.
- It is mainly used for robotics and electronics projects.
